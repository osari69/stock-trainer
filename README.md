# stock-trainer
A virtual investor where you get to choose the stocks and the volume of your portfolio. Made with Python.
Draft 1 - Stock Trainer

Create an interaction between the python program and stock market data through Alpha Vantage API so that the user can follow a specific stock, virtually invest in it, see their change and other data about it. 

Goals: Allow user to virtually invest how ever much money they want into a specific stock to see how much they would yield in a certain day. 

Stretch Goals: Allow multiple portfolios of different stock data, kind of like save files. 

Super Stretch Goals: Add in recommendations for stock to invest in. 
Scope: Allow user interaction through a command line, asking for input from the user for the code to calculate investments from day to day. 


2/16 Hello World!

2/23 Pick a stock API

3/1 Find a way to implement the API into to the Python Project

3/8 Parse API data, to take things that are relevant. 

3/15 Manipulate stock data from API 

3/22 Save the net gains from each day 

3/29 Analyze net gains from single stock from each consecutive day 

4/5 Have the program make the save files if it is the first launch (if statements)

4/12 Conveniently store and recall stock symbols and stock volume from user (linked list? array?)

4/19 Variable persistence using files created by the code

4/26 Make user input prompts more readable and easier to use 


Milestone 1: Get stock data into Python project. 

Milestone 2: Saving the progress each day.

Milestone 3: Saving variables from each launch

Milestone 4: Saving stock symbols and stock volume from user input, usable on next launch
